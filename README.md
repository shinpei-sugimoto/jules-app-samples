# A Little Spark of Joy - Daily Inspiration Website

This project is a simple, static web page designed to bring a little spark of joy to your day. It displays inspiring quotes and features a pleasant, calming interface.

## Features

*   **Inspiring Quotes:** Displays a new inspirational quote each time you load the page or click the refresh button. Quotes are fetched from an external API.
*   **Fallback Quotes:** If the API is unavailable, a selection of predefined quotes will be shown.
*   **Interactive Button:** A "Click Me!" button that fetches a new quote and provides a subtle visual feedback.
*   **Clean Design:** A visually appealing and responsive design using modern CSS.

## How to View

1.  **Clone this repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**
    Navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the files and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

    You can usually do this by:
    *   Double-clicking the `index.html` file.
    *   Right-clicking the file and choosing "Open with..." and selecting your browser.
    *   Typing the file path into your browser's address bar (e.g., `file:///path/to/your/cloned/repo/index.html`).

That's it! We hope this little page brightens your day.
